# Application Settings

The Application Settings feature centralizes user preferences and sync account access.

## Appearance
- Select Light, Dark, or System theme.
- Theme preference persists locally and follows system settings when chosen.

## Sync account
- Register or sign in to enable server sync across devices.
- Sign out to return to local-only mode.

## Notes
- When signed in, changes are synced to the server and broadcast to other devices.
- Without authentication, the app operates fully in local-only mode.
